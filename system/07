cat /var/run/sshd.pid

# sshd will typically write a PID file which by default is located at /var/run/sshd.pid. In this file you can find the process ID of the listening sshd process.

# Other commands that we could use to get the PID of the SSHD service are the following :
# ps aux | grep -e /usr/sbin/sshd | grep -v grep | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f2
# systemctl status ssh | grep 'Main PID' | cut -d ' ' -f4
