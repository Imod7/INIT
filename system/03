In order to change the name of our system permanently, we follow the below steps :
- In terminal we change to root user
- We edit the file /etc/hostname with the command "vi /etc/hostname" and we change the current name of the system to the new one
- We save and close the file
- We do the same to the file /etc/hosts
- We run the command "hostnamectl set-hostname [new_system_name]"
