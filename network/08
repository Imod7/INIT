I can give to the terminal one of the below commands :
- dig +short NS slash16.org | sed 's/.$//'
- whois slash16.org | grep "Name Server"

The command output would be the following lines :
ns-686.awsdns-21.net
ns-1989.awsdns-56.co.uk
ns-1236.awsdns-26.org
ns-144.awsdns-18.com
which are the Name Servers of the domain name slash16.org.

From this result, I can see that the provider is awsdns and aws stands for Amazon Web Services. But if I am not sure, I can also go to a web browser and open a DNS Lookup website of my choice, like mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx. There, I insert one of the name servers from the command output and the result will show me a message like the following :
   Your DNS hosting provider is "Amazon Route 53"
So from this meesage again I can confirm that the provider of slash16.org is Amazon.
