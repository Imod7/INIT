I can give to the terminal one of the below commands :
- dig +short NS slash16.org  
- whois slash16.org | grep "Name Server"

The command output would be the following lines :
ns-686.awsdns-21.net.
ns-1989.awsdns-56.co.uk.
ns-1236.awsdns-26.org.
ns-144.awsdns-18.com.
which are the Name Servers of the domain name slash16.org.

Then I go to a web browser and open a DNS Lookup website of my choice, like mxtoolbox.com. There, I insert one of the IPs from the command output and the result will show me a message like the following :
   Your DNS hosting provider is "Amazon Route 53"
This message tells us that the provider of slash16.org is Amazon.
