In order to make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85, I would do the following steps :
1) I would open the /etc/hosts file
2) Go to the corresponding line where intra.42.fr (currently cdn.intra.42.fr) is mentioned
3) On the left of the cdn.intra.42.fr I can see the IP 10.68.1.1 which I would change to 46.19.122.85 

These are the steps I would follow if the file /etc/hosts was not readonly.
