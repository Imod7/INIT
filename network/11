From the output of the previous command (traceroute slash16.org) we see that the first hop is the IP address 10.11.1.254 which is the default gateway.
On the second hop of the traceroute command is the IP address 10.60.1.1 which looks like the NAT (Network Address Translation). From this hop the link between my computer (local network) and the outside world is made.
